- first we validate the access token with the help of backend api.
- if the access token is valid then fetch the user details from the api.
- to fetch the user details , we need to call another api.

- to go to the login screen again "click on login via another account"


/**
Future Planning
**/

1) In future , once the person login , save its details from the login response in redux store.
2) fetch the data from redux , if data is not there is redux , only then call the api of fetching the user required.
